Disease Stage is a Strong Predictor
	•	Patients in Stage 1 have the lowest risk (HR = 0.1299), meaning 87% lower risk compared to Stage 4.
	•	Higher stages (Stage 2 & 3) also show increased risk but not as extreme as Stage 4.

Ascites & Edema Significantly Impact Survival
	•	Ascites (HR = 1.76) → 76% higher risk of death.
	•	Edema (HR = 2.24) → More than double the risk of death.

 Bilirubin is a Major Risk Factor
	•	Each unit increase in bilirubin raises the death risk by 13% (HR = 1.13, p < 0.0001).
	•	Higher bilirubin levels indicate poorer survival.

Albumin is Protective
	•	Higher albumin levels reduce risk (HR = 0.44, p = 0.0026).
	•	Suggests better liver function is linked to longer survival.

Platelets & Hepatomegaly have weaker effects
	•	Platelets show a weak association with survival (HR = 0.9987, p = 0.203).
	•	Hepatomegaly is not statistically significant in predicting survival.
